<h1>Routing</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>
    Wherever possible, we recommend using the <code inline>&lt;a&gt;</code> element to link to different parts of your
    site. This is not only helpful by bringing in the default UI behaviour for links, it is also semantically helpful
    for SEO.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you are making a single page app, the navigation to another address could be unhelpful for state
    management. Ika helps resolve this issue with built-in routing functionality. At the document level, Ika attaches an
    event listener for <code inline>click</code> events that originated from <code inline>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, and
    will prevent default behaviour if the <code inline>&lt;a&gt;</code> element has the <code
        inline>data-ika-target</code> custom data attribute.
</p>
<p>
    The data attribute tells Ika which <code inline>&lt;ika-route&gt;</code> container element the navigation event
    wishes to render new content into. This corresponds to the <code inline>key</code> attribute on the element in
    question. Read more about the <code inline>&lt;ika-route&gt;</code> element's specifications <a
        href="./components.html" data-ika-target="docContent">here</a>.
