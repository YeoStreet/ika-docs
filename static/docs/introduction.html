<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p style="border: 1px solid;padding: 1rem;">
    <b>WARNING</b>: Ika is still in development and can abandon certain APIs with no notice. It is not recommended for
    use in production code, and should be used in an exploratory, experimental manner only.
</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Ika is named from 以下 in Japanese, which means "less".</p>
<p>Ika was born out of the desire to reduce framework specific knowledge and workflows needed in front-end web
    development. It's a project started when a developer building his eCommerce website in React was eventually fed up.
    As the project grew in scale, he thought the very specific patterns a framework required him to follow was
    counterproductive. He hated wasting time on problems caused by package inter-dependencies. He found it tedeous to
    debugging code that's been compiled and processed in multiple passes.</p>
<p>The web was invented to work with three very basic elements: HTML, for content; CSS, for presentation markup, and JS,
    for interactivity. The front-end frameworks came at a time when the needs of web development outpaced the evolution
    of web standards.</p>
<p>Take React for example. Disregarding its many other useful features for frequently updating, complex UIs, being able
    to write a component once and reuse it without copying and pasting was a transformative experience for devs.</p>
<p>But the web has grown now. It is incorporating many of the popular features of JS frameworks into standard web APIs.
    Web Components is one such effort. Granted, it is nowhere as full featured as the vibrant ecosystems around the most
    popular front-end frameworks, it is often enough.</p>
<p>When standards have improved, the tradeoffs from using a front-end framework should be re-evaluated. Is it still
    worth the investment to make framework specific code? Is the network payload for the framework worth it for the
    features it brings?</p>

<h2>Standards driven</h2>
<p>If you followed the Quick Start guide, sorry. It was a trick. The best way to display "Hello, world" on a page is
    simply write it in HTML. As follows from the motivations for Ika, we champion using as little JS as possible to
    achieve your front-end result.
</p>
<p>If Ika doesn't reduce the time you spend to achieve your result, don't use it at all! This is possible because Ika
    works with the DOM API and other standard Web APIs. It does not have a virtual DOM, or use synthetic events, or need
    a diffing algorithm.</p>

<h2>Ergonomics first</h2>
<p>Ika is useful over standard Web APIs because it saves you time writing boiler plate code, and abstracts away some
    code execution order concerns. At the same time, it strives to be unopinionated so that you can use it in a way
    that's most productive and natural for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you prefer to update elements directly through JS in your component's logic, you can do so. But if
    you want to use data bindings in HTML code without writing in logic, you can do so as well.</p>

<h2>Zero dependencies</h2>
<p>
    Ika keeps things as simple as possible, using standard Web APIs to achieve what it needs wherever possible. As a
    result, the code base is able to have no external dependencies, and we want to keep it this way to avoid "dependency
    hell".
</p>
<p>As a result, the production package of Ika stays at a slim ~15kb gzipped, compared to ~46kb gzipped for React and
    React DOM.</p>
