<h1>Handling Events</h1>
<p>ðŸ‘‹ To dive right in, see this example's complete code via this <a
        href="https://codepen.io/imdavidmin-the-flexboxer/pen/JjaNjmR">CodePen</a> link.</p>
<p>
    A key demand for front-end work is to respond to user input, or on the technical level, a DOM event. Whenever
    practical, we recommend using native event handler interfaces, such as the <code inline>onclick</code> attribute or
    the <code inline>attachEventListener()</code> method. </p>
<p>
    However, if you want to call a bundled method of an Ika component, it may be inpractical at times to manually
    specify, from the child node level, which DOM node is the parent Ika component.
</p>
<h2>Using <code inline>&lt;ika-bf&gt;</code> for events</h2>
<p>
    An easy way to trigger a function call at the Ika component parent is to use the Ika provided component <code
        inline>&lt;ika-bf&gt;</code>. Using the custom data attribute <code inline>data-*</code> on the <code
        inline>&lt;ika-bf&gt;</code> allows you to catch events of the indicated type from any child of the element, and
    invoke a function on the Ika component that has the key as indicated by the data attribute's value.
</p>
<p>
    For example, you could write <code inline>&lt;ika-bf data-click="clickHandler"&gt;</code> to bind all click events
    from child nodes of this element to the parent Ika component's <code inline>clickHandler()</code> method.
</p>
<p>
    Under the hood, Ika relies on <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events#event_bubbling">event
        bubbling</a> behaviour to invoke function calls requested by a child node. Each Ika component listens to special
    events that bubble up in the DOM tree, and stop the event's propagation if the event has reached its intended
    component. <code inline>&lt;ika-bf&gt;</code> components construct these special events and attach event listeners
    to itself all based on HTML markup, saving you the time to write this logic in JavaScript manually.
</p>

<h2>Leaping past Ika components</h2>
<p>
    Occasionally, you may find it necessary to include an Ika component within the template of another Ika component,
    and have some child element nested inside. If you want the child element to invoke a function on its "true" parent,
    you can add the <code inline>leap</code> attribute. An integer value here tells Ika how many levels of Ika
    components upwards in the DOM to skip over to reach the "true" parent.
</p>
<code>
    <pre class="ht">&lt;data-handler&gt;</pre>
    <pre class="ht">   &lt;presentation-container&gt;</pre>
    <pre>       <span class="ht">&lt;ika-bf</span> <span class="attr">leap</span>=<span class="val">"1"</span> <span class="attr">data-click</span>=<span class="val">"clickHandler"</span><span class="ht">&gt;</span></pre>
    <pre>           <span class="ht">&lt;button&gt;</span>Click me!<span class="ht">&lt;/button&gt;</span></pre>
    <pre class="ht">   &lt;/presentation-container&gt;</pre>
    <pre class="ht">&lt;/data-handler&gt;</pre>
</code>

<h2>Constructing events manually</h2>
<p>
    Since all Ika components extend <code inline>HTMLElement</code>, you can also attach an event listener on the
    element, and dispatch <code inline>CustomEvent</code> or <code inline>Event</code> yourself.
</p>
<p>
    However, remember that by default, events do not bubble through the shadow DOM barrier, unless you put in the <code
        inline>composed: true</code> option when constructing the event. See the <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/Event#syntax">syntax</a>
    for the Event constructor. You should also make sure the event bubbles upwards, which is not the case by default.
