    <h4>Optional parameters on creating a component</h4>

    When using the <code>createIkaComponent()</code> method, you will always need to pass the component's name as a
    string in the first parameter. Optionally, you can pass in a second parameter as an object with the following keys:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>templateId</code>: Gives a template element ID that is not the default (same as component name).
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>construct</code>: Passes in a function to be executed in the constructor. It will have
            <code>this</code> bound to the component class.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>eventBinds</code>: Specifies what events the component will listen to and capture, as an array of
            strings. All Ika components will listen to and capture <code>click</code> events, as well as Ika
            internal events that bubble as <code>CustomEvent</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>
