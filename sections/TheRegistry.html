<h3>The Registry</h3>
In the previous sections, we talked about the Buffer and data binding. We also showed how you can split your code and
load them on demand. All of this works because each element that needs to bind to some state is registered with the
Registry.

<h4>Dynamic vs Static nodes</h4>
Nodes on the DOM tree can be considered by Ika as being either <i>static</i> or <i>dynamic</i>. A text node, or a plain
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, for example, would not be able to bind to a state or trigger callbacks, and are
therefore considered static. Dynamic nodes could change their properties or attributes based on state change. In both
component level state binds and inglobal binds, the node that bind to the state is identified by information kept in the
Registry.<br><br>

The distinction is more easily viewed through understanding Ika's publisher / subscriber pattern. Nodes that bind to
some state is a subscriber, and subscribers are dynamic nodes for Ika. Or, viewed through the Buffer's perspective, any
node target of an intended DOM change is a dynamic node.<br><br>

From Ika's point of view, it does not need to worry about nodes that won't change, and we mean nodes, not components.
Say there's a button that says <code>Pay Â£x now</code>, and the amount updates based on cart contents. The button itself
is not a dynamic node - the button's child nodes and its own attributes do not change. The amount does change, as it's
wrapped up in a <code>&lt;ika-b&gt;</code> node. It is the <code>&lt;ika-b&gt;</code> node that's considered a dynamic
node, and would have a registration with Ika.

<h4>Identifying nodes</h4>
To identify nodes easily, each dynamic node is first registered with the registry, and receives a unique node ID string.
When there is some intended DOM change, and that change is recorded into the Buffer, it is stored under the key that
corresponds to the node's ID. When another intended DOM change needs to be recorded, Ika can look for a key in the
Buffer that matches the node's ID, instead of traversing through some array to find an identical node. <br><br>

Ika also uses this ID to register callbacks in bindings. When a binding changes, all registered callbacks are invoked.
However, if a node is removed, the callback should be unregistered. For Ika to know which callback to remove, each
callback record is registered with a node ID.<br><br>

<h4>Registering and deregistering nodes</h4>
Components created though Ika and the core custom components provided by Ika automatically register themselves when
initialised.

Ika will deregister disconnected nodes in two ways. Invocations associated with a particular registered node could
happen in the following places:
<ul>
    <li>
        Global bind callbacks held by the <code>#binds</code> object inside a <code>IkaRegistry</code> instance
    </li>
    <li>
        Component level bind callbacks held by the <code>#binds</code> object inside a <code>IkaComponent</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Intended DOM changes inside the <code>#buffer</code> object inside a <code>Buffer</code> instance
    </li>
</ul>

At invocation, node IDs will be checked against their associated node's <code>isConnected</code> property. If the node
is no longer connected, the node with that node ID will be deregistered from the Registry. However, deregistration in
the Registry is not broadcast. It is up to each implementation to remove the node from their subscribers.

<code>ika.reg</code> method <code>subscribeToBind()</code>, <code>setBindValue()</code>

<code>IkaComponent</code> methods <code>registerCbForStateBind</code>, <code>deregisterCbForStateBind</code>
<code>BindingComponent</code> methods <code>onParentComponentLoaded()</code> to establish chain, and
<code>registerBind()</code> and <code>deregisterBind()</code>
<code>IkaBuffer</code> to identify any node that needs to be updated.
