<h3>Introduction</h3>
What is Ika? With Ika, the simplist working example would be <code>Hello world!</code>. The result is predictably:

<div class="section">Hello world!</div>

What does that mean? It means Ika is not an all encompassing, strongly opinionated way to create web pages and web apps.
It means Ika is only there when it adds value, and not needed if it doesn't. The name gives a clue:

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.75rem; margin: 1rem">以下</div>

Ika, the name, is based off of this Japanese word, meaning "less". Our overarching philosophy is to reduce the amount of
scripting involved to make your web page or web app possible. This makes your project more debuggable and
understandable, and could also make your output package smaller in size.

<h4>Web Components</h4>

Central to how Ika works is Web Components, a web standard widely implemented by all modern browsers. Web Components
make it possible for you to create encapsulated, reusable components, similar to popular front-end frameworks like
React and Vue. The difference is, however, that as a web standard, you do not need to load in a JavaScript library file
for the whole thing to work, or to code in the framework's specific ways. Web Components are cross-framework compatible.
Read more about them on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">MDN</a>.<br><br>

Web Components exist, however, primarily as a presentation technology, and does not yet include data binding features.
Ika provides the tools that fill that gap. It will allow you to give your Components persisted states, allow data
bindings, and more complex interaction logic.<br><br>

Ika also provides additional, optional, "quality-of-life" components that makes it easier to get what you want onto the
screen, like mapping a data set onto HTML elements, instead of having to write each of them out in HTML. You can choose
not to use them at all, or implement your own version instead.

<h4>Main concepts</h4>

Unlike front-end frameworks like React, Ika does not implement a Virtual DOM. This doesn't mean, however, that Ika will
write every UI change directly to the DOM and cause a reflow. Instead, Ika implements what we call a <b>Buffer</b>,
which will hold information on intended changes to the DOM.<br><br>

Central to the Buffer model is what we call <b>UPS</b>, or <i>updates per second</i>. If you are a gamer, then this is
equivalent to FPS. The idea here is that if a human user can only perceive a certain number of changes per second,
there's no need to update the DOM more frequently than that, even if the DOM at some points in time is out of sync with
what it should look like.<br><br>

The Buffer keeps a list of all intended DOM changes in between update <b>ticks</b>. On each tick, Ika will process the
Buffer and work out what DOM changes need to be made at that point in time.

<h4>What's next</h4>

We'll assume you already have background knowledge on how web components work, as well as long established technologies
like CSS and JavaScript. Ika aims to use web standards wherever possible, so you should know how to create a basic web
page using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br><br>

If you are already familiar with another front-end framework, some core concepts like prop passing or what a "state" is
could be inappropriate to how Ika works. <br><br>

In the next sections, we'll show you how to bind DOM elements to states of your custom component.
